# ML Agents | Maze Solver

Here's some good plain fun. A procedurally generated maze built off of [Ray Wenderlich's maze tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/82-procedural-generation-of-mazes-with-unity) and tweaked heavily to support arbitrary map sizes, empty or filled interiors, as well as a (badly solved) path to follow, treasures, and obstacles!
